## NYC-Building-Energy-Intensity

This project attempts to classify whether a given building in NYC is above or below the national median in Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) using building energy consumption data from the 2016 Energy and Water Data Disclosure for New York City Local Law 84.

For modeling I use feature and target data from New York City buildings from the 2016 calendar year. Data was cleaned, analyzed, and categorical data was label-encoded.

There was a fairly even distribution of “successful” and non-successful high schools given graduation rates.
